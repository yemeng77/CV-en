    summary: |
      I am a researcher major in computational condensed matter physics.
education:
    - degree: PhD in Condensed Matter Physics
      university: Peking University
      time: 2012 - 2017
      details: |
        My advisor is Porf. Jing Lu. My research interest is in the study of the 
        electronic and transport properties of low dimensional materials by using 
        the first-principles calculations.
    - degree: BSc in Material Chemistry
      university: Peking University
      time: 2007 - 2012
      details: |
        Besides the chemical courses, I also completed all the required courses 
        for physics major students in those 5 years.
          - GPA: 3.64/4.0
experiences:
    - role: Postdoctoral Researcher
      time: 2017 - Present
      company: Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing
      details: |
        My advisor is Dr. Xiangwei Jiang. My research interest is in the development
